# STEM Ecosystem Portal
## Executive Summary
It's no surprise that STEM fields are incredibly important in this day and age. Omaha STEM Ecosystem is one of many organizations that strive to help parents, teachers, counselors, and students connect to grow interest in these fields early. The tricky piece is having an easy-to-use platform to facilitate this communication. Our goal is to make this as easy as possible by building a custom web application which achieves the following:
* Creates a community-driven portal to host and find events
* Caters recommended events based on user's interests
* Helps STEM Ecosystem collect data on event turnout and overall user interest

We believe this is an opportunity to build an experience for the next generation of STEM students. This project will provide a portal to facilitate communication various students and the subjects and projects they're interested in. The end of this project will include a baseline for STEM Ecosystem to grow into the future with their users on a scalable platform to help continue the advancement of students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.
