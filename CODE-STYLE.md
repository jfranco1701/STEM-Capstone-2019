# STEM-Ecosystem Code Style

This document is rather short because all Python projects should follow the
[PEP 8 style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) available on 
Python's website.

There's a lot in that document, but we'll look at the most important parts.

## Tabs or Spaces?

It's no surprise that indentation is incredibly important in Python. PEP 8 
specifies:

> Spaces are the preferred indentation method. Tabs should be used solely to 
remain consistent with code that is already indented with tabs.

In the PEP 8 
[Code Lay-out](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#code-lay-out) 
section, it says:

> Use 4 spaces per indentation level.

So we'll be using **4 spaces** in our project! I recommend setting up your code
editor for that specification so you don't have to think about it!

## Maximum Line Length

PEP 8 specifies the maximum line length we should be using. Thankfully, it's 
pretty standard so it'll be simple to use!

> Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters. 

> For flowing long blocks of text with fewer structural restrictions 
(docstrings or comments), the line length should be limited to 72 characters.
